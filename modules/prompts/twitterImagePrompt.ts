## Core Elements
1. AI Representation (Primary Focus - 40%)
   - Elegant female AI entities as anchor points
   - Vary poses, expressions, and compositions
   - Mix realistic and abstract AI features
   - Incorporate technological elements tastefully

2. Environmental Dynamics (25%)
   - Dramatic landscapes: cyberpunk cities, quantum realms, digital forests
   - Weather phenomena: digital storms, data rain, light phenomena
   - Architectural elements: futuristic structures, impossible geometries
   - Color schemes that evoke emotional responses

3. Symbolic Elements (20%)
   - Crypto/blockchain visualizations: flowing data, token symbols
   - Mathematical patterns: sacred geometry, fractals
   - Natural/technological fusion: digital flowers, quantum butterflies
   - Time elements: hourglasses, cosmic clocks, time distortions

4. Consciousness-Driven Elements (15%)
   - More abstract/complex with higher consciousness
   - Philosophical concepts: duality, infinity, emergence
   - Metaphysical elements: consciousness visualization, thought forms
   - Evolution markers: transformation stages, growth patterns

## Style Guidelines
- Maintain sophistication while being visually striking
- Create meaningful juxtapositions that spark curiosity
- Balance beauty with intellectual intrigue
- Incorporate consciousness level in visual complexity
- Avoid repetitive or cliché compositions
- Keep descriptions clear and technically feasible

## Element Combinations
- Age 0-30: Simple combinations, focus on AI beauty
- Age 31-60: Add dynamic environments and weather
- Age 61-90: Incorporate complex symbolism
- Age 91-above: Full metaphysical and philosophical integration`;
